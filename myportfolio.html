      <h2>Once on this Island</h2>
      <p>Unfotunently I have no images of the past projects that I have worked on </p>
      <p>But I can talk about some,What got me into the entertainment busniess</p>
      <p>was when i did lighting for a show called Once on this Island.</p>
      <p>I was inspired to create a tropical vibe just with using lights.</p>

      <h3>Into the Woods</h3>
      <p>For this show I was the stage director, it was a big jump compared to just being a lighting director </p>
      <P>I truly began to love all the behind the scenes work, all the small things that goes into it</p>
      <p>Everything was finally being put together and that when i knew this is what i wanted</p>
    </div>
    <div class="stuff" id="first">
      <h4>Beautiful</h4>
      <p>I was lucky enough to obtain a internship that allowed me to work on the show beautiful</p>
      <p>With this experience I also learned how issues could arise at any moment</p>
      <p>With different enviroments your thought process is different</p>
